#Validation discussion and overview

###Overview

*Validation* is the process of verifying that some commitment made by the issuer of a green bond to its investor has been fulfilled in the "real world". Validation is essentially a three step process.

1. Issuer makes an abstract commitment relating to their fundraising objectives. These are detailed in their framework document in prose form. For the purposes of the GAW we encourage issuers to break down their prose commitments into succinct and atomic "Commitments" which are part of the GAW "Framework" and can be explicitly associated with evidence about their fulfillment in the form of reports.
2. Issuer makes a concrete commitment to provide some specific evidence which links the abstract commitment to a project instance, and some measurable criteria for success of that project. This step explicitly identifies a project, a commitment from the framework governing that project, the form of the evidence which will later be submitted, and the entity who will provide that evidence -- the "Validator".
3. The validator provides whatever evidence it is that the issuer specified. This can be text, figures, images, documents, special files. Our structure enables this information to be totally ad-hoc and flexible.

###Commitments

Within the structure defined by the Green Bond Principles (GBP) GAW commitments will usually relate to statements of intent under the headings "Eligibility Criteria" and "Use of Proceeds". Below is a example 

1. Funds will be used for the installation of solar energy generation capacity in the following forms: i) modern glass roofs and walls with thin film technology, ii) solar panels for electricity generation, iii) glass tiles with underlying absorbers for heating. 
2. Projects will be located in areas where the level of GHG emissions is high
3. Projects will deliver substantial reductions of GHG emissions 
4. Installations shall use existing buildings, not prospecting of new land.
