# Issuer guide

## Profile creation 

When you first login, you will have the opportunity to fill out your profile. This is your opportunity to present yourself to other users of the system. Please provide a concise description of your organisation, and if you choose you can also describe the high-level objectives behind your green investment activities. A logo and a link to your homepage completes your profile.

## Framework creation

Then comes the critical step of creating your framework. There are a few things to explain here, but don't worry it's quite simple. Bear in mind that the "framework" is an abstraction of the various different ways in which issuers describe the rules that govern their green obligations that we have encountered in our research. It is inspired by the "Green Bond Framework", but if you use a different system, it can almost certainly be adapted to fit in this system.

### Framework name

Your existing framework, if you have one, may or may not have a name that is meaningful. If it does then you should probably use it here, if it doesn't, you could opt for "Organisation name framework", or take the opportunity to communicate something more about the purpose of your capital raise.

### Framework description

As above, this is a good place to add more context and information about what you are doing, why, and how.

### Framework documents

Here you are free to upload any materials you would like to flesh out or document your framework. If you have a green bond framework or equivalent document, it should go here, as should any second opinion, third party assurance, or other documents that would be valuable to an investor in evaluating your offering.

### Commitments

This is the most important part of your framework. This should be a distillation of the core elements of your promise to investors. That could relate to impact reporting obligations, your project eligibility criteria, or a guarantee of exclusion, such as a commitment not to finance fossil or nuclear projects. Commitments are valuable because they are an extremely clear and succinct way for investors to know what they can expect from you as an issuer. They are powerful because they can be used for validation later, that means that reports can be created which provide evidence of the fulfillment of a specific commitment. For commitments to be useful for validation, there are some guidelines that you should try to adhere to when writing them, or adapting your existing material.

1. A commitment should refer to *one thing only*. That means that you should ideally be able to provide an evidence point which categorically supports the entire content of the commitment in question. For example, the commitment "all projects will achieve an energy performance of 100kWh/m2 or less" is very good, because you can provide evidence in the form of an energy report or audit which categorically demonstrates that the commitment has been fulfilled. In contrast, the commitment "all projects will achieve an energy performance of 100kWh/m2 or less with over 90% of energy supplied coming from renewable sources" is a little more ambiguous. It is possible that a single piece of evidence could support both of those criteria, but also possible that it only supports one. Better to instead create two distinct commitments: "all projects will achieve an energy performance of 100kWh/m2 or less" and "at least 90% of energy supplied to all projects will come from renewable sources".
2. Similarly, if they are to be used for validation, commitments should be phrased in a way that is *verifiable*. Think of it as formulating a scientific hypothesis that you will subsequently attempt to "prove".
3. The phrasing should be as clear, concise, and unambiguous as possible.

### SDGs and Use of Proceeds Categories

Here you can select from the UN SDGs and the categories defined in the Green Bond Principles. This is mostly useful for investors who are seeking to direct their funds towards a specific kind of green activity, perhaps in line with their own commitments to the SDGs, or perhaps more generally.

## Bond creation

This is intuitive.

## Project creation

Your projects are the meat of your GAW presence. This is where you document your real activities, where your investors money is being put to work, and where real and measurable impact is created. We encourage you to document your projects as extensively as possible. We know that some of you have changing portfolios of projects, or you fund intermediaries who develop projects and you are not necessarily at liberty to disclose details about them. We believe that the more you disclose, the more transparent and powerful the GAW becomes. But in the mean time, feel free to create obfuscated projects which you can report on without disclosing any confidential information, or create a "batch project" which can stand in for what is in reality several different projects. We hope that full project level disclosure will soon become the norm, but in the meantime these represent constructive compromises.

## Pools

Pools are intended to allow you to group your bonds and projects together where possible. This allows investors to clearly see which bonds finance which projects. It also allows for impact reporting to be more granular, because investors can know how much impact their specific investment corresponds to, and how their money has been spent. All bonds and projects are grouped together under a single pool by default, so if you don't want to make use of this functionality you don't have to. Otherwise, it's as simple as creating a new pool (and naming it something sensible) and linking the bonds and projects you would like to group to that new pool. The pool will not be visible to other users of the system, but when an investor views a bond, the "associated projects" which are displayed are those which share a pool with the bond in question. The calculated proportion of impact for a given portfolio will also use the pool in this way.

## Impact report creation

Once you have created a project, you will be able to attach impact reports to it. Impact reports currently cover three indicators: energy consumption, energy generation, and emission avoidance. Creating them is straightforward. Bear in mind that you should add one impact report only per year per project. Documentation should be included which details where the information has been derived from and any other useful context. It is important to include a description of your methodology for calculating emission avoidance, as without understanding the assumptions and methodology behind the calculation, the number becomes quite useless.

## Validation report creation

Validation reports are a bit more complex. They are created in two steps, first you as issuer will create the form for the validation information, then a "validator" that you identify will provide the information that you specify. Validators have a presence in the GAW just as you do, you can browse for suitable validators if you like, or if you have a preferred third party verifier already, you can suggest that they apply for a GAW account so your verification can move to the next level. After you have identified a validator and figured out what commitment you would like to validate, the process is simple. For example, if you wanted to provide evidence of the construction of a large scale solar plant in a remote area, you could use a validator who specialises in collecting and analysing satellite imagery.

1. Identify the commitment to be verified ("A large scale (10MW+) solar installation will be built in sub-Saharan Africa")
2. Identify the evidence that you believe will be convincing and practical to provide ("sequential satellite images over three years of the site at GPS coordinates x")
3. Identify the validator who you think will provide the evidence, ideally approach them first to check that they are able and willing
4. Create a form with a file upload slot ready to receive the images in question.
5. Submit your report, and you are ready to be validated. Your investors know they can expect satellite verification in the future, your validator can provide it as soon as they are ready to do so, and your investors know the moment their expectations have been fulfilled.
6. Together, you and your validators build a track record of credible activity over time, leading to greater trust and more investment.
